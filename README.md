# Where-to-Advertise-an-E-learning-Product

The project is part of our Statistics Intermediate: Averages and Variability course, and it assumes familiarity with:  

Sampling (populations, samples, sample representativity) 
Frequency distributions 
Box plots and bar plots
Summary metrics (especially the mean) 
pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn

In this project, we’ll aim to find the two best markets to advertise our product in, we’re working for an e-learning company that offers courses on programming.

We’ll analyze existing data about new coders to find the best markets to invest in for advertisting. To make our recommendation,

we’ll try to find out:

-Where are these new coders located.

-Which locations have the greatest number of new coders.

-How much money new coders are willing to spend on learning.

After analyzing the data, the only solid conclusion we reached is that the US would be a good market to advertise in. 
For the second best market, it wasn’t clear-cut what to choose between India and Canada. 
We decided to send the results to the marketing team so they can use their domain knowledge to take the best decision.

For more details, please refer to the the full analysis in notebook file.
